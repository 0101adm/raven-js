# Raven.js

This is a JavaScript client for the [Sentry](http://getsentry.com/) realtime event logging and
aggregation platform.

Stacktraces are captured and parsed in the most sane way possible, thanks to [TraceKit](https://github.com/occ/TraceKit).

**Raven.js v1.0 and above requires Sentry v5.3 or later. If you are running an
earlier version of Sentry, you should use Raven.js pre 1.0.**
